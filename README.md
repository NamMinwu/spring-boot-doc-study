# 📚 Spring Boot 문서 따라잡기

This repository contains my personal study notes for understanding and rewriting the official Spring Boot documentation.  
My goals:
- Improve my technical English reading & writing
- Prepare for open source contribution
- Build a strong developer communication skillset

Each section contains:
- Original sentence
- My interpretation (Korean)
- Simplified or clarified rewrite
- Explanation why I changed it
